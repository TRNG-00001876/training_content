# Training_content

Welcome to Revature! Over the course of this curriculum we will prepare you to break into the industry as full stack software developers. This curriculum covers full stack development from persistence to UI. The curriculum will include Java, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, and several modern libraries and frameworks including Spring & Angular. In this repository we will keep our notes and any pertinent information. Much of the same content can be found in RevPro as well, but this will be our primary repository for such things.
