What is SQL? 


T-SQL - Transact SQL(Extension of SQL). [SQL SERVER]

Diff betn SQL and TSQL

diff 1: sql is a query language for manipulating data stored in database
	T- SQL is also a query language, its an extension of SQL primarily  used in SQL server

diff 2:  SQL is open source, T- SQL is developed and owned by Microsoft.

diff 3: SQL statements are executed one at a time, called non-procedural language
	T-SQL executes in a procedural way.


select * from Employee ORDER BY age LIMIT 10 ;// SQL

select TOP 10(*) from users order by age;// T SQL




select ISNULL(0,age) from users;



DDL:  Data Definition Language
		- > used to define and modify the database structure	
		- > Create, alter, drop, truncate, rename

DML: Data manipulation language
		-> insert, update and delete

DQL: Data Query Language
		-> Select

DCL: Data Control language
		->Grant, Revoke,

TCL: Transaction control language
		-> Begin, commit, rollback,savepoint, 


SQL Data types,


Numerics:    bit, tinyint, smallint, int, bigint, decimal, numeric, 
		money(	-922,337,203,685,477.5808 to 922,337,203,685,477.5807),
	smallmoney(-214,748.3648 to 214,748.3647),

Approximate Numerics:  Float, Real

Data & time:  date(	0001-01-01 through 9999-12-31),
		 datetime, time, smalldatetime,datetimeoffset,

Charcter strings:  char, varchar, text(0 to 2,147,483,647)

Unicode char:  nchar,nvarchar, ntext


To create a table:

Create table [table_name]( pk_column_name data_type PRIMARY KEY, 
			   column2 data type [ Null | Not null ],
			   column3 data type [ Null | Not Null ]

			   [ table _constraints ]
	);


Add columns in this table:

		-> add a column
		-> rename a column
		-> delete a column

Alter table tablename add colm_name1 data_type constraint, colm_name2 data_type constraint;

Rename a column or table we use system stored procedure sp_rename;


Syntax:

EXEC sp_rename 'oldname','newname',[obj,type]

DElete a colums of a table:

"ALter table drop column"


Alter table [ table_name ]  DROP column colm1,colm2..coln;


Create schema <schema_name> [ Authorization owner_name ]
